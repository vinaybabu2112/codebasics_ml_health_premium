# 🩺 Health Insurance Premium Prediction

> A machine learning project to predict medical insurance premiums using demographic and health data, inspired by the Codebasics ML course.

---

## ✅ Project Overview

- **Objective:** Build predictive models to estimate insurance premiums based on features such as age, BMI, gender, smoking habits, and health conditions.
- **Modeling Approach:** Includes Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering, regression modeling (Linear Regression, XGBoost), and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Evaluation:** Quantify model performance via metrics like R², MAE, RMSE—Codebasics-based implementations often report accuracy around 99% or R² ~0.98+ :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

Alternatively, you can test predictions via:

```bash
python main.py --age 45 --bmi 28.3 --smoker yes --region northeast --...
```


## 📊 Key Highlights

* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized variable distributions, identified outliers, and uncovered key correlations.
* **Feature Engineering:** Handled categorical variables, derived BMI categories or interaction terms.
* **Model Building:** Tested Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Ridge/Lasso regression models.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Achieved R² \~0.98+ (or error margins within \~10%)—high predictive accuracy aligns with Codebasics reported benchmarks ([geeksforgeeks.org][2]).

## 📉 Results & Insights

* Age, BMI, and smoking status were among the **strongest predictors** of insurance premium rates.
* Tuned XGBoost models consistently outperformed linear alternatives after hyperparameter optimization.
* Prediction errors remained low, with most predictions falling within ±10% of actual premium values.

---

## 👥 Usage

* Use the **Jupyter notebooks** to walk through the full EDA and model development pipeline.
* Run `main.py` to generate premiums for custom inputs.
* You may extend the project by deploying via Streamlit or Flask for interactive use (similar to Codebasics portfolios) ([codebasics.io][3], [codebasics.io][4]).
