# ðŸ©º Health Insurance Premium Prediction

> A machine learning project to predict medical insurance premiums using demographic and health data, inspired by the Codebasics ML course.

---

## âœ… Project Overview

- **Objective:** Build predictive models to estimate insurance premiums based on features such as age, BMI, gender, smoking habits, and health conditions.
- **Modeling Approach:** Includes Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering, regression modeling (Linear Regression, XGBoost), and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Evaluation:** Quantify model performance via metrics like RÂ², MAE, RMSEâ€”Codebasics-based implementations often report accuracy around 99% or RÂ² ~0.98+ :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
